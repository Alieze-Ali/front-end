## MVP
* As a business owner you will be able to create an account to login and list items for sale.
* As a customer (user) you will be able to access the website without a login to browse (possibly only prompted to give email for order updates and API stores customer email associated with an order number if we went that far, but I believe MVP does not require user account functionality)
* Owner accounts can see a list of items and prices relevant to the selected category (unclear where these categories are set as API MVP is item with subset location, name, description, and price)
